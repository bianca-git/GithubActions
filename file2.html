<div>On May 10, 2022, the<strong> </strong><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/lifecycle/products/windows-10-home-and-pro" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Home and Pro</a> editions of<strong> </strong>Windows 10, version 20H2, and all editions of
  Windows 10, version 1909 will reach end of servicing. The May 2022 security update, released on May 10, is the last update available for these versions. After that date, devices running these editions will no longer receive monthly security and quality
  updates containing protections from the latest security threats.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>To help keep you protected and productive, Windows Update will automatically initiate a feature update for Windows 10 home and non-managed business devices that are at, or within several months of reaching end of servicing. This keeps your device supported
  and receiving monthly updates that are critical to security and ecosystem health. For these devices, you will be able to choose a convenient time for your device to restart and complete the update.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>As always, we recommend that you update&nbsp;your&nbsp;devices to the latest version of&nbsp;<a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2021/11/16/how-to-get-the-windows-10-november-2021-update/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Windows 10</a>,
  or upgrade eligible devices to <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2021/10/04/how-to-get-windows-11/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Windows 11</a>. For more information on end of servicing dates for currently supported versions
