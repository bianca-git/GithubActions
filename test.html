  When there is a broadly impacting issue that affects multiple services across the M365 services, Microsoft will create a single incident that will properly reflect the overall status of the different services if affects. In the message details of this
  incident, we will call out specific services impacted. With this change we will also be giving a refreshed user experience to the service health dashboard.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=88666" target="_blank" style=" ">88666</a>.</p>
<p>[When this will happen:]</p>
<p>We expect this to begin rolling out in late April and expect the rollout to be completed by late May.&nbsp;</p>
<p>[How this will affect your organization:]</p>
<p>In the service health dashboard, you will see the following changes.</p>
<ul>
  <li>All active issues will now appear in the top table on the page.</li>
  <li>The services status will correctly reflect if any issue is affecting it.</li>
</ul>
<p>New active incidents and advisories will still have a single service that is assigned to, in most cases of broadly impacting issues it will be Microsoft 365 Suite. The incident or advisory will have a new field that lists any affected services that it
  may also impact. If you have filtered your view to only show select services the incident or advisory will still show up if that service is being affected, same goes for email notifications. If you have signed up for email notifications of new issues
  that affect your tenant, you will continue to receive them for the services you selected as long as that service is being affected.&nbsp;</p>
