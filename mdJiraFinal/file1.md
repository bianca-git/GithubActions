Preview an improved Windows Update experience for Windows 11 with two new capabilities coming soon. Whether you use Configuration Manager or Windows Update, both the IT admins and their end users will soon be able to leverage the native Windows Update experience to keep you protected and productive. You can learn more and prepare with the list of the prerequisites, step-by-step instructions, and demo videos in the [Windows IT Pro Blog|https://aka.ms/Windows/SeamlessUpdates]. 

 

*When will this happen:* 

These new capabilities can already be previewed but will officially be released in the summer of 2022. 

 

*How this will affect your organization:* 

Now IT admins and their end-users will receive a more tailored and user-friendly native update experience. This experience will be unified across different management solutions, on-premises and on the cloud, as well as for customers using the Configuration Manager or the Windows Update for Business. All typical configurations in Client Policy, Software Updates, and Computer Agent will still apply and will not change. 

 

*What you need to do to prepare:* 

Make sure the devices are running Windows Insider Preview Build 21277 or later. To try out these features before the release, you must be part of the Technical Preview. Consult additional prerequisites for organizations using the Configuration Manager or Windows Update for Business within the blog.
