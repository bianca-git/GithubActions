<div>The<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/security/trusted-root/program-requirements" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Microsoft Root Certificate Program</a> supports the distribution of root certificates, enabling customers to trust Windows products. As was previously announced in March 2022, the <a href="https://www.idmanagement.gov/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">United States Federal PKI team</a> formally requested the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/troubleshoot/windows-server/windows-security/microsoft-trusted-root-store-removal-of-us-federal-common-policy" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">removal of the "Federal Common Policy" root certificate</a>, also known as the "G1" root certificate, from the Microsoft Trusted Root Program.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>When will this happen:</strong></div><div><br></div><div>On May 24, the "G1" root certificate will be removed by an out-of-band update.

Applications and operations which depend on the "G1" root certificate will fail after the retirement of the certificate on this date, and systems may experience issues that affect important scenarios including:</div><ul><li>TLS or SSL connections</li><li>Client authentication, including establishing VPN connections</li><li>Smart card or PIV authenticated access, including badge access that relies completely on Windows software</li><li>Secure or multipurpose internet Mail Extensions (S/MIME) or secure email</li><li>Signed documents in Microsoft Word (PDF and Adobe Acrobat files will not be affected)</li></ul><div><br></div><div><strong>What you need to do to prepare:</strong></div><div><br></div><div>Before May 24, the "G2" root certificate must be implemented on environments that require the change.
